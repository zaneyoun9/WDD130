      <h3>Blade Rates</h3>
      <p>
        [Why come to the site
        The real reason for this website that I am trying to develop is to help people understand drop rates of all the rare blades in the game Xenoblade Chronicles two.  The reason this website will be helpful for people is because the drop rate system for core crystals, relating to common and rare blades, can be quite complicated as there are many factors in the game that influence the ability of pulling rare and commons blades in the game. 
        Overall goal
        So, what I aim to do is to provide all the various factors such as luck, stats, compatibilities of drivers and blades, the various types of core crystals, and the individual drop rate of the blade and how they are affected by all those modifications I previously listed. All of that different information can be very difficult to process and read. So, I seek to provide the information simply and in a very concise manner.

      <h3>[Audience Info]</h3>
      <p>
        [Target Audience
        The target audience of the website is really quite simple. People who play the game. Otherwise, the website has no meaning and is just a bunch of random numbers with various unknown conditions that really mean nothing to some one who has not played the game. 
       Questions users might have
       The questions expected to be answered for the audience of my web site are primarily thus, ‘what are the chances that I pull any one rare blades of their choosing in the game Xenoblade Chronicles two.’ Another question to be answered by my website are ‘what are all the different factors involved that will increase my chances of pulling a rare blade in Xenoblade Chronicles two.’ 
       Activities of users
       The types of activities of those who come to my site want to be looking at spread sheets will all sorts of different data about the rare blades and how you can get them out of a core crystal. They will also want it in a clear manner so they can promptly get back to playing the game. As they are mainly looking for a quick reference sheet.
       Information
        The information that would be necessary for visitors of my site would be first and foremost knowledge of the game. They would also need to know which rare or what type of common blade they want to pull. So that way they can look at the information provided by my website and use it to their benefit in the hopes at having a better overall experience with the game Xenoblade Chronicles two.

      </ul>
      <h3>[Other sites]</h3>
      <p>
        [Competition
        The reason why some one would come to my site instead of any other is simply because there is only one other site that provides the information about rare and common blade drop rates and statistics. That particular site is really strange and hard to use and very difficult to read the information provided especially for people new to the game. There is also a reddit thread that provides information, however it just provides raw data. So if you wanted to know your chances at getting a rare blade you would need to do the calculations yourself and you would also need to read through the many page long explanation about how to even interpret the data provided in the reddit thread. So, I think if I could make a website that simply presents the information and will do the calculations for the user with given inputs. I am even thinking about adding a feature where one could select the parameters, they want to calculate in order to obtain a rare blade. I think it would be a highly popular website among the people who play Xenoblade Chronicles two.

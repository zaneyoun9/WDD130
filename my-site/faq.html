    <h1 class="question">
      I can't seem to get Akhos, Cressidus or Patroka what am I doing wrong?
    </h1>
    <h2 class="answer">
      That would be because certain games are locked until you beat the game and
      start a new game plus play through. The blades unlocked in new game plus
      are Akhos, Cressidus, Obrona, Patroka and Perdido.

    <h1 class="question">
      I still have not gotten KOS-MOS what is up with that?
    </h1>
    <h2 class="answer">
      If you look at the table you will see that she has not only the lowest
      drop rate, she also never increases her drop rate no matter what group you
      are in. She is the rarest blade in the whole game so there are a couple of
      factors that can increase your chances at getting KOS-MOS. Considering she
      is a light blade that means she is affected by the justice driver stat. So
      make sure that the driver you are trying to pull her on has high justice.
      Also the driver has a stat called luck which has a couple of gameplay
      bonuses one of which it increases the rate at which rare blades drop so if
      you improve your luck stat on the selected driver it will greatly improve
      your chances at pulling KOS-MOS. The type of core crystal you use also
      greatly affects ones chances at pulling rare blades. Naturally the best
      variety of core crystal for pulling rare blades would be the legendary
      core crystal.

    <h1 class="question">
      I can't seem to get Akhos, Cressidus or Patroka what am I doing wrong?
    </h1>
    <h2 class="answer">
      That would be because certain games are locked until you beat the game and
      start a new game plus play through. The blades unlocked in new game plus
      are Akhos, Cressidus, Obrona, Patroka and Perdido.

    <h1 class="question">
      What is the best way to get legendary core crystals?
    </h1>
    <h2 class="answer">
      The Relentless Ardun superboss at the farm in Torigoth outside of the
      ardanian military base, is a very efficient way to farm legendary core
      crystals. In order to unlock the super boss you have to talk to the guy at
      the farm, and keep feeding the ardun until you can't anymore. It has a
      large health pool so you can smash it many times and has very low combo
      resistances. This can net you a lot of core crystals very fast.

    <h1 class="question">What are the best blades to try and pull?</h1>
    <h2 class="answer">
      This question is kinda hard to answer. A lot of it is a matter of opinion.
      The main reason because the game provides you with the two best blades in
      the game. Which are Mythra and various forms of Poppi. Though KOS-MOS is
      one of the best blades in the base game. So trying to pull her is a very
      good idea. Another blade of note to pull is Adenine because she increases
      all drops and rewards from battle. All of the other blades are mostly
      equal.
    </h2>
    <h1 class="question">
      I still have not gotten KOS-MOS what is up with that?
    </h1>
    <h2 class="answer">
      If you look at the table you will see that she has not only the lowest
      drop rate, she also never increases her drop rate no matter what group you
      are in. She is the rarest blade in the whole game so there are a couple of
      factors that can increase your chances at getting KOS-MOS. Considering she
      is a light blade that means she is affected by the justice driver stat. So
      make sure that the driver you are trying to pull her on has high justice.
      Also the driver has a stat called luck which has a couple of gameplay
      bonuses one of which it increases the rate at which rare blades drop so if
      you improve your luck stat on the selected driver it will greatly improve
      your chances at pulling KOS-MOS. The type of core crystal you use also
      greatly affects ones chances at pulling rare blades. Naturally the best
      variety of core crystal for pulling rare blades would be the legendary
      core crystal.

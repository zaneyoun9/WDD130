        When looking at the table above you will notice there are a couple of
        different probabilities of getting rare blades based on the groups
        specified in the table. These groups are randomly chosen by the game and
        are linked to your save data. So once you are in a game your group is
        selected and cannot be changed. Unless you start a brand new game and
        differnt save data. If you want to be able to find out what group your
